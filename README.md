# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures
Algorithms and Data Structures course at KTH

The aim of the course is to provide a solid knowledge of how one designs and analyses the most important classes of algorithms. 
The course intends to give the students skills that give them the opportunity to design computer programs that uses time and memory in an efficient way independently. 
The students should learn to identify problems that uses too much resources to be solved efficiently or that indeed is impossible to solve with common computing models. 
At the end of the course the students should be able to develop their own algorithms to problems and be able to compare different solutions and their efficiency.
